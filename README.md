# AI-assisted Frontend Hackathon: The 90-Minute Vanilla JS Challenge
### - Event Date: August 12, 2025
### - Duration: 1.5 Hours (90 minutes)
### - Challenge Focus: UI/UX Enhancement using HTML, CSS, & Vanilla JavaScript

## 1. Hackathon Guidelines & Context
### 1.1. Theme & Objectives
  The theme for this challenge is **"Refining the Learning Experience with AI-Assisted Frontend Design."** A functional application is only half the battle; a great user experience makes learning engaging and effective.

You will be given a functional but plain-looking quiz application boilerplate. Your mission is to transform it into a visually stunning, highly interactive, and delightful user experience. This hackathon is a test of your design sense, your CSS and JavaScript skills, and your ability to use AI tools to rapidly create beautiful and intuitive interfaces.

**Your primary objectives are to:**

- **Enhance**: Take the provided boilerplate and dramatically improve its User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).

- **Design**: Apply principles of good design, including layout, color, typography, and interactivity to create a polished product.

- **Accelerate**: Demonstrate strategic use of AI tools for design ideation, asset generation, CSS styling, and JavaScript animations.

- **Communicate**: Clearly present your transformed application and explain your design choices.

### 1.2. Rules & Allowed Tools
- **Team Size**: This is an individual challenge.

- **Tech Stack**: You must only use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

- **Core Logic**: You must not break the core quiz functionality of the provided boilerplate. You can add to or refactor the JavaScript for better interactivity, but the quiz must remain fully functional.

- **AI Tools**: You must use any publicly available AI tools to assist with design, asset creation, and coding.

- **Consultation not Collaboration**: You can ask your classmates for information about something that you find difficult. However you are not allowed to do anything on behalf of each other.

### 1.3. Expected Deliverables (at the 90-minute mark)
- **A Live URL**: A publicly accessible link to your deployed web application (e.g., via Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

- **Source Code Repository**: A link to your GitHub repository.
  - The repository should contain all the prompts that you have used.

## 2. Boilerplate Overview & Enhancement Goals
You will start with a simple, unstyled quiz application. Your goal is to build upon this foundation.

### 2.1. Provided Boilerplate Files
You will receive a zip file containing:

```index.html```: Contains the basic semantic structure for the quiz.

```style.css```: Contains only the most basic, plain CSS.

```script.js```: Contains all the core logic for a functional quiz.

### 2.2. Your Enhancement Goals
You will be judged on how well you improve the boilerplate. Focus on these areas:

- **UI Overhaul**: This is the primary goal. Completely redesign the visual presentation. Think about layout, color palettes, fonts, and spacing.

- **Theming**: Give the quiz a creative theme that matches a specific higher education subject (e.g., a "space" theme for an astronomy quiz or a "retro terminal" theme for a coding quiz).

- **Interactive Feedback**: Go beyond the alert(). Add smooth animations and clear visual cues for correct/incorrect answers.

- **Progress Visualization**: Make the score and progress bar more engaging and visually appealing.

- **Accessibility**: Ensure your final design is accessible (e.g., good color contrast, keyboard navigable buttons).

## 3. Technical Requirements
### 3.1. Tech Stack (Strict)
- HTML5

- CSS3

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

### 3.2. Leveraging AI Tools (Mandatory)
- **Design & Assets**: Use AI to generate a color palette, a background image, icons, or a logo (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E).

- **CSS Generation**: Use AI assistants (e.g., Copilot, Gemini) to write complex CSS.

- **JavaScript for Interactivity**: Use AI to help write or refactor JavaScript functions for animations and DOM manipulation.

- **Content**: Use an AI to generate new quiz questions if you want to change the topic to better suit your theme.

## 4. Grading System

| Category                             | Weight | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| :----------------------------------- | :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Interface (UI) Transformation** | 35 pts | How visually impressive and well-designed is the final product compared to the boilerplate? Assesses layout, color, typography, and aesthetics. |
| **User Experience (UX) & Interactivity** | 30 pts | How does the application *feel* to use? Are the animations smooth? Is feedback clear and immediate? Is it fun and engaging?                     |
| **Strategic AI Integration** | 25 pts | How effectively were AI tools used to achieve the design and interactivity goals? Did AI enable a higher quality result within the time limit?   |
| **Code Quality & Creativity** | 10 pts | Is your added HTML, CSS, and JS clean, well-organized, and efficient? Did you implement a particularly clever feature or theme?                               |

#### **Bonus Points**
* **Up to +10 Points:** Awarded for truly exceptional features like a theme switcher (e.g., light/dark mode), sound effects, or complex, original CSS animations.

#### **Penalties**
* **Broken Functionality:** If the core quiz logic (loading questions, checking answers, updating score) is broken in the final submission, the "User Experience (UX) & Interactivity" category will receive a score of **0**.


## 5. Example Enhancement Themes

Use these ideas as a jumping-off point for your creative theme.

1.  **Theme: "AstroQuiz"**
    * **Target Course:** Astronomy
    * **UI/UX Ideas:** Use an AI-generated starry night or nebula as a background. Style buttons to look like planets. The progress bar could be a rocket moving across the screen. Use glowing text effects.

2.  **Theme: "The Ancient Scroll"**
    * **Target Course:** History or Literature
    * **UI/UX Ideas:** Use a parchment or papyrus texture for the background. Employ serif fonts like "Cinzel" or "Merriweather". Buttons could have a wax seal design on hover. Animate questions as if they are being unrolled.

3.  **Theme: "Bio-Lab"**
    * **Target Course:** Biology / Chemistry
    * **UI/UX Ideas:** A clean, laboratory-style interface with a grid background. Use a color scheme of blues, greens, and whites. Icons could be beakers, DNA strands, or microscopes. Animate the progress bar to look like a filling test tube.
